how to install django globally
To install Django globally, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Install pip, the Python package installer. If you already have it installed, skip this step. To install pip, use the following command:
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. This step is optional but recommended, as it helps avoid conflicts between different versions of Django or other packages. To create a virtual environment, use the following command:
python -m venv myenv

Replace “myenv” with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment. The command to activate the virtual environment depends on your operating system and shell. For example:
On Windows (cmd):
myenv\Scripts\activate

On Windows (PowerShell):
myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


On macOS/Linux (Bash):
source myenv/bin/activate

Once the virtual environment is activated, install Django globally using pip:
pip install django

This command will install the latest stable version of Django. If you want to install a specific version, use this format:

pip install django==version_number

Replace “version_number” with the desired Django version (e.g., “4.1.2”).

Verify the installation by checking the Django version:
django-admin --version

This command should display the Django version you just installed.

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you’re done working with it:

deactivate
